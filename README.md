I’ve been working with computers for thirty years and programming for the web for twenty of those. I am well-versed in HTML, including HTML5, and Javascript, including ES6 and jQuery, on the front end, and PHP, Python, MySQL, and Apache on the back end; I have also worked with ColdFusion, ASP, and Ruby, as well as Node.js and Angular 1.0.

I have a bachelor’s degree in Classical Studies from Earlham College, and experience in live theater - on and o  stage. Additionally, I have worked with statistics and data management, and am published both scholastically and in  ction. All of this helps me bring a unique perspective to my programming and development.
