I’ve been working with computers for thirty years and programming for the web for twenty of those. I am well-versed in HTML, including HTML5, and Javascript, including ES6 and jQuery, on the front end, and PHP, Python, MySQL, and Apache on the back end; I have also worked with ColdFusion, ASP, and Ruby, as well as Node.js and Angular 1.0.

I have a bachelor’s degree in Classical Studies from Earlham College, and experience in live theater - on and off stage. Additionally, I have worked with statistics and data management, and am published both scholastically and in fiction. All of this helps me bring a unique perspective to my programming and development.

Since 2012, I've been working as a freelancer so that I could maintain my parents' house for them and, since I'm a single parent, make sure my son had the parental support he needed to grow up and finish high school. Now that he's graduated and moved out, I'm looking forward to rejoining the workforce on a more permanent basis.

## Location
I strongly prefer remote work, and (barring special requirements) do not need additional equipment to be able to work remotely. I cannot relocate at the moment.
